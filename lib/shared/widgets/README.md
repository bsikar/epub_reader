# Shared Widgets

This directory contains reusable UI widgets shared across multiple features.

## Purpose
Widgets in this directory should:
- Be reusable across multiple features
- Implement common UI patterns
- Be feature-agnostic

## Examples
- Custom buttons with specific styles
- Form inputs and validators
- Dialogs and modals
- Cards and list items
- Navigation components
- Custom animations

## Note
For core widgets (error states, loading indicators), use `core/widgets/` instead.
For feature-specific widgets, place them in the respective feature's presentation layer.
